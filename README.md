# Python learning

Some notebooks I have created as I have been learning how to do various things in Python. Some need additional datasets which are referenced as links in the notebook. These are work in progress as I learn more and add more to this repo.

## Requirements

Need to add some sort of requirements.txt file. The required libraries can be found from the imports in the notebooks.


## Geospatial stuff

This includes notebooks for generating regular geometries (hexgrids and square grids) and transforming quantities from one geometry to another:

- HexGrid.ipynb
- RegularGridShapefiles.ipynb
- UniformPopulationEstimates.ipynb

## Some pandas notes

Some notes that I've made to remind me how to do things that I regularly use like groupby operations and working with time variables:

- pandas_notes.ipynb
- time_in_pandas.ipynb

## Webscraping

From my blog post on Introduction to Webscraping

- Intro_to_webscraping_010121.ipynb

## Some stats stuff

Worked examples of things like positive predictive values, linear regression, stats tests:

- diagnostic_tests.ipynb
- essential_medical_stats_ch12.ipynb
- linear_regression_basics.ipynb
- ppv.ipynb
- stats_tests.ipynb
