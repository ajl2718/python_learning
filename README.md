# Python learning

Some notebooks I have created as I have been learning how to do various things in Python. Some need additional datasets which are referenced as links in the notebook. These are work in progress as I learn more and add more to this repo.

## Requirements

Need to add some sort of requirements.txt file. The required libraries can be found from the imports in the notebooks.


## Geospatial things

This includes notebooks for generating regular geometries (hexgrids and square grids) and transforming quantities from one geometry to another:

- [HexGrid.ipynb](https://github.com/ajl2718/python_learning/blob/master/HexGrid.ipynb)
- [RegularGridShapefiles.ipynb](https://github.com/ajl2718/python_learning/blob/master/RegularGridShapefiles.ipynb)
- [UniformPopulationEstimates.ipynb](https://github.com/ajl2718/python_learning/blob/master/UniformPopulationEstimates.ipynb)

Cleaning US postal addresses
- [us_postal_address_data_cleaning.ipynb](https://github.com/ajl2718/python_learning/blob/master/us_postal_address_data_cleaning.ipynb)

## Some pandas notes

Some notes that I've made to remind me how to do things that I regularly use like groupby operations and working with time variables:

- [pandas_notes.ipynb](https://github.com/ajl2718/python_learning/blob/master/pandas_notes.ipynb)
- [time_in_pandas.ipynb](https://github.com/ajl2718/python_learning/blob/master/time_in_pandas.ipynb)

## Webscraping

From my blog post on Introduction to Webscraping

## Machine learning / AI / generative AI

Re-creating results from papers to understand some techniques for data labelling, large language models and genAI.

- [ravfogel_2023.ipynb](https://github.com/ajl2718/python_learning/blob/master/ravfogel_2023.ipynb)
- [active_inference.ipynb](https://github.com/ajl2718/python_learning/blob/master/active_inference.ipynb)

## Some stats

Worked examples of things like positive predictive values, linear regression, stats tests:

- [diagnostic_tests.ipynb](https://github.com/ajl2718/python_learning/blob/master/diagnostic_tests.ipynb)
- [essential_medical_stats_ch12.ipynb](https://github.com/ajl2718/python_learning/blob/master/essential_medical_stats_ch12.ipynb)
- [linear_regression_basics.ipynb](https://github.com/ajl2718/python_learning/blob/master/linear_regression_basics.ipynb)
- [ppv.ipynb](https://github.com/ajl2718/python_learning/blob/master/ppv.ipynb)
- [stats_tests.ipynb](https://github.com/ajl2718/python_learning/blob/master/stats_tests.ipynb)
- [ml_stats_animations.ipynb](https://github.com/ajl2718/python_learning/blob/master/ml_stats_animations.ipynb)
